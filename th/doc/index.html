<h1>th</h1>

<p>The following pages describe both the th library and the supplementary rwlock library and how to use them:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="th.html">Cooperative Multithreading library</a></li>

<li><a href="rwlock.html">Readers/Writer Locks</a></li>

</ul>

<h2>Assumptions</h2>

<p>Here are some assumptions made in the libraries and in the documentation:</p>

<ul>

<li>You know how to write assembly language. If you don't, then why are you trying to do multithreading in assembly language?</li>

<li>You have some use for multithreading.</li>

<li>You use <a href="http://www.sqrt.com/">tpasm</a> (and possibly <a href="http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/339/33997.html">other utilities</a> for it), your assembler accepts tpasm's syntax, or you can convert the assembly-language files to your assembler's syntax.</li>

<li>You define the starting address of an uninitialized segment named "data", used for data (surprise, surprise!).</li>

</ul>

<p>Other assumptions are made, but those are the major ones.</p>
