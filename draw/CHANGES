	* CLEAR key now has to be held down for about half a second to clear
	  the image. This is done by using the interval timer.
	* The cursor position is now shared with the graph screen.

	* Added a few "standard" cursors (busy, crosshair, default, and text
	  cursors).

2006-12-26 through 2006-12-29:
	* Designed framework for mouse interrupt, events, and callback loop.
	* Wrote mouse interrupt and event system.
	* Added acceleration to mouse movement through the use of decreasing
	  delays in movement. Started with linear decrease in delays, then
	  changed to exponential decrease in delays.
	* Fine-tuned mouse acceleration. Added movement parameters that are
	  adjustable at compile-time.
